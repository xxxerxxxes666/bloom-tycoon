# Codex Build Notes

## 2026-07-01 repo setup for Hermes audit

- Restored the full Bloom Tycoon project into the current repo root from the local handoff source.
- Confirmed the HTML playable is present at `playable/midnight_bloom_prototype.html`.
- Confirmed required tile assets are present in `assets/tiles/48` and `assets/tiles/96`.
- Added `docs/hermes_audit_next_tasks.md` as the Hermes-maintained task queue.
- Added this build log so future Codex passes can summarize each coding pass.
- Added repo-level agent instructions requiring future Codex passes to read Hermes' task file before coding.
- Added Git ignore rules that keep local scratch output out of the repo while preserving required tile PNG assets.

## 2026-07-01 Vercel deployment

- Read `docs/hermes_audit_next_tasks.md` before making this pass.
- Deployed the static repo to Vercel.
- Renamed the Vercel project to `bloom-tycoon`.
- Live URL: https://bloom-tycoon.vercel.app/
- Disabled SSO deployment protection so Hermes can open the URL directly.
- Verified the root page, `playable/midnight_bloom_prototype.html`, and `assets/tiles/96/amber_resin_seed.png` return `200 OK`.
- GitHub repo creation was completed in the next pass below.

## 2026-07-01 GitHub repo creation

- Installed a local GitHub CLI in ignored `work/tools/` to avoid requiring a system install.
- Authenticated GitHub CLI as `xxxerxxxes666`.
- Created the public GitHub repo `xxxerxxxes666/bloom-tycoon`.
- Added `origin` and pushed `main`.
- GitHub URL: https://github.com/xxxerxxxes666/bloom-tycoon
- Enabled GitHub Pages from `main` at `/`.
- GitHub Pages URL: https://xxxerxxxes666.github.io/bloom-tycoon/
